title: Setting up a free blog or a website with custom doamin!
---

I spent some time trying to figure the best and cheapest way to host my own website (+ blog). This post talks about few points of that journey.

1. Bought a domain [theox.in](theox.in) in [Godaddy](http://godaddy.com/)
2. Searched alot about which blogging platform to choose. My main requirements being:
  * It should be very light-weight.
  * It should support custom domain mapping.
  * It should be cheap or if possible, free.
  * It should be flexible to customize.
3. I tried several options out there and finally chose on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). The solution takes advantage of Github Pages.
4. Main reasons why I chose Jekyll being:
  * I don't have to pay anything extra and can have my custom domain for the website.
  * Since the webpage is nothing but Github page of a repo, adding a post means committing changes to Github repo, which means, increased activity of my Github profile - a boon for a consultant like me.
5. I will detail the process of setting up the Jekyll website in another blog.
6. If I hadn't have chosen Jekyll, I would've probably started blogging in [Medium](https://medium.com/). It was also pretty cool.
